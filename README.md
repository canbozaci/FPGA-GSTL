# FPGA-GSTL
These are codes that I've written in my first internship (ITU GSTL) in VHDL. I've shared the source files, couldn't share it with tcl files to initialize project properly due to my lack of knowledge in tcl script.

Project 1:
· Half Adder
· Full Adder
· N-BIT RC Adder


Project 2: 
· N-BIT Subtractor Using RC Adder
· Logical Shifter
· Arithmetic Logic Unit (with respect to the table below)

Project 3:
· 0-255 Up-Down-Counter Design Using RC Adder - State Machines


Project 4:
· Design of the State Machine (with respect to the picture below) 
· Pattern Recognition (1101011) and Serial to Parallel Design.

Project 5:
· Traffic Lamp (with respect to the picture below)
· Vending Machine Design That Sells Water for 1 TL (Inputs are 1 TL, 0.5 TL, 0.25 TL) (Design that doesnt give change and the one that gives change)
